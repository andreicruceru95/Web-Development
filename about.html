        <p>About me</p>
        <strong>Present:</strong> <br> <br>
        Full-time student at Buckinghamshire New University and part-time Specialist cleaning manager at Ryemead Comercial Group. <br><br>
        I am curently studying Data science at Bukcs New University. I enrolled for this course in September
        2020 and I am expected to graduate in June 2023. <br> <br> What is <a href="Data-science.html">Data Science</a>? <br>
        <a href="https://bucks.ac.uk/">About Buckinghamshire New University</a>. <br> <br>
        Enrolling on this course is one of my teenagehood dreams. I have always been pasioned about computers and 
        computer programming, and therefore is one of my biggest recent accomplishments. <br> <br>
        As a Specialist Cleaning Manager, I undertake various project in the cleaning industry. The tasks are always challanging, and include 
        Railway work, Steam Cleaning, Deep Restoration, industrial roof cleaning, Deep Factory cleaning, industrial carpet cleaning, industrial floor 
        cleaning, Comercial Window Cleaning and most recently, Covid-19 Desinfection. <br> <br>
        My role involves managing  the projects and on site teams across the country, writing reports and feedbacks, and dealing with customers. <br>
        Many of this projects were carried out for prestigious clients like F1 Williams, Equinix Data Centre, Winchester University, ISS, Licester Hospital, Wycombe Abbey,
        Kawasaky Motors, Johnson & Johnson, Intel, YMCA, Aktrion Group, Hilton and many others. <br><br>

        I live in High Wycombe, Buckinghamsire, home of Buckinghamshire New University. I have been living here since 
        December 2015, one year after I graduated college. <br> Before that, I lived in Romania which is the country of my nationality. <br> <br>

        <strong>Past:</strong> <br><br>
        I lived in Romania until 2015. This is where I obtaind many skills and qualifications while attending college. 
        I was a very good student and wanted to continue my higher education there, but unable due to financial reasons. <br>
        However, this seems to have been beneficial to me, as now I can attend a better, more prestigious and more globaly recognised university. <br>
        One year after my college graduation I moved to UK, where I carried a variety of jobs and build many skills. While living and 
        working in the UK, I continued to study from home, completing online courses and learning the basics of programming languages like 
        Java, Phyton, R and SQL, but also undertake some basics projects to learn more about the physical concepts of computing and asembley language. <br>
        Some of this projects include creating a magic mirror using a Raspberry PI, building my own Desktop tower, creating a retro game from scratch. <br>
        In 2018 I started my curent job as an operative, and since then I obtained several promotions that lead to becoming a 
        Specialist Cleaning Manager. <br><br>

        <strong>Future:</strong> <br><br>
        My plan is to graduate as a Data Scientist with knowledge in Software Engeneering. Programming is something that allow us to create 
        anything we want, and our imagination is the limit. And I enjoy programming for this reason. <br><br>
        After graduation I would like to research domain knowledge to improve my data science abilitites and become a worldwide recognised 
        Data Scientist. <br>
        For myself, is really important to succeed. I want to breakthrough my current working enviroment and inspire other people 
        in my situation. I have already come a long way, and I would like to help other people like me to do the same. <br><br>

        <p>Education</p>
        I studied Maths and IT, and graduated at Colegiul National Nicolaie Titulescu -Pucioasa, Romania
         between 2010-2014. This is where I started learning my first programming language, creating simple aplications and algorithms using
         Pascal. <br><br>

         Here, I studied Microsoft Office and obtained my European Computing Driving License qualification(ECDL). <br><br>

         I also studied SQL language through an Oracle Academy Program, and obtaind a <strong>Database Design and 
             Programming with SQL</strong> diploma. <br> <br>
        
          <br><strong>Oracle Corporation</strong> is an American multinational computer technology corporation headquartered in Austin,
          Texas. The company was formerly headquartered in Redwood Shores, California until December 2020 when it 
          moved its headquarters to Texas. The company sells database software and technology, cloud engineered 
          systems, and enterprise software productsâ€”particularly its own brands of database management systems. 
          In 2019, Oracle was the second-largest software company by revenue and market capitalization. 
          The company also develops and builds tools for database development and systems of middle-tier software, 
          enterprise resource planning (ERP) software, Human Capital Management (HCM) software, customer relationship 
          management (CRM) software, and supply chain management (SCM) software. <br><br>

          <p>Hobbies</p>
          I have a deep passion for learning new skills, which is one of the reasons why I chose to pursue this career. <br>
          One of the biggest challanges in Data Science is the ability to keep up with the industry's skills requirements. New,
          more specialised tools and programming languages are created all the time. A lot of this tools are implemented 
          by different companies, and mastering this skills is vital to succeed as a Data Scientist. <br>
          Another challange for Data Scientists is the large amount of domain knowledge required. You can not be a successful Data Scientist 
          unless you have a deep knowledge of field. <br>
          This being said, a data scientist will never stop learning. <br><br>

          Another passion I have is to travel the world. <br>
          I have already seen a lot of countries and cities, and I put toghether a breakdown of things I learned while visiing them,

            In the ten weeks I have spent as a student, I have learned to create this website, how to create and administrate 
            database in Microsoft Access, the basics of computer science, and how to program in Java. <br><br>
            If you would like to see my progress, I have put together a list of projects I have been working on <a href="#navcol-1">here</a>.
