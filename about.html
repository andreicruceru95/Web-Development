            My name is Andrei, and I am a <a href="Data-science.html">Data Science</a> full time student at <a href="https://bucks.ac.uk/">
            Buckingamshire New University</a>, in High Wycombe. <br>
            I have started the course in September 2020 and I am expected to graduate in June 2023. <br>
            I have been living in <a href="https://www.visitbuckinghamshire.org/article/high-wycombe">High Wycombe</a> since December 2015,

             between 2010-2014. This is where I started learning my first programming language, creating simple aplications and algorithms using
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)">Pascal</a>. <br>
             Here is where I also obtained my <a href="https://icdleurope.org/">European Computing Driving License</a> qualification, 
             and my <strong>Database Design and Programming with SQL</strong>, an <a href="https://academy.oracle.com/en/oa-web-overview.html">Oracle Academy Course</a>. <br>

              <p>Passions and Hobbies</p>
              I have a deep passion for learning new skills, which is one of the reasons why I chose to pursue this career. <br>
              One of the biggest challanges in Data Science is the ability to keep up with the industry's skills requirements. New,
              more specialised tools and programming languages are created all the time. A lot of this tools are implemented 
              by different companies, and mastering this skills is vital to succeed as a Data Scientist. <br>
              Another challange for Data Scientists is the large amount of domain knowledge required. You can not be a successful Data Scientist 
              unless you have a deep knowledge of field. <br>
              This being said, a data scientist will never stop learning. <br><br>

           <p>And I have learned so much already <br>

                In the ten weeks I have spent as a student, I have learned to create this website. <br><br>
                I have also learned to program in Java, which I find really fun. As a learning experience, we were 
                asked to create a game. And so I did, with the help of two of my coleagues. <br><br>
                Unfortunatly, we did not yet cover creation of graphics with Java, so I was forced to improvize. I 
                decided to display images on the terminal window, using two dimensional arrays as game maps, and html4 and html5 characters 
                as game objects. You can find more informations about the game <a href="BlueJ-Game.html">here</a>.
