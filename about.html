          Timeline
        </h2>
        <p>Present:</p>
        Full-time student at Buckinghamshire New University and part-time Specialist cleaning manager at Ryemead Comercial Group. <br><br>
        I am curently studying Data science at Bukcs New University. I enrolled for this course in September
        2020 and I am expected to graduate in June 2023. <br> <br> What is <a href="Data-science.html">Data Science</a>? <br>
        <a href="https://bucks.ac.uk/">About Buckinghamshire New University</a>. <br> <br>
        Enrolling on this course is one of my teenagehood dreams. I have always been pasioned about computers and
        computer programming, and therefore is one of my biggest recent accomplishments. <br> <br>
        As a Specialist Cleaning Manager, I undertake various project in the cleaning industry. The tasks are always challanging, and include
        Railway work, Steam Cleaning, Deep Restoration, industrial roof cleaning, Deep Factory cleaning, industrial carpet cleaning, industrial floor
        cleaning, Comercial Window Cleaning and most recently, Covid-19 Desinfection. <br> <br>
        My role involves managing the projects and on site teams across the country, writing reports and feedbacks, and dealing with customers. <br>
        Many of this projects were carried out for prestigious clients like F1 Williams, Equinix Data Centre, Winchester University, ISS, Licester Hospital, Wycombe Abbey,
        Kawasaky Motors, Johnson & Johnson, Intel, YMCA, Aktrion Group, Hilton and many others. <br><br>

        I live in High Wycombe, Buckinghamsire, home of Buckinghamshire New University. I have been living here since
        December 2015, one year after I graduated college. <br> Before that, I lived in Romania which is the country of my nationality. <br> <br>

        <p>Past:</p>
        I lived in Romania until 2015. This is where I obtaind many skills and qualifications while attending college.
        I was a very good student and wanted to continue my higher education there, but unable due to financial reasons. <br>
        However, this seems to have been beneficial to me, as now I can attend a better, more prestigious and more globaly recognised university. <br>
        One year after my college graduation I moved to UK, where I carried a variety of jobs and build many skills. While living and
        working in the UK, I continued to study from home, completing online courses and learning the basics of programming languages like
        Java, Phyton, R and SQL, but also undertake some basics projects to learn more about the physical concepts of computing and asembley language. <br>
        Some of this projects include creating a magic mirror using a Raspberry PI, building my own Desktop tower, creating a retro game from scratch. <br>
        In 2018 I started my curent job as an operative, and since then I obtained several promotions that lead to becoming a
        Specialist Cleaning Manager. <br><br>

        <p>Future:</p>
        My plan is to graduate as a Data Scientist with knowledge in Software Engeneering. Programming is something that allow us to create
        anything we want, and our imagination is the limit. And I enjoy programming for this reason. <br><br>
        After graduation I would like to research domain knowledge to improve my data science abilitites and become a worldwide recognised
        Data Scientist. <br>
        For myself, is really important to succeed. I want to breakthrough my current working enviroment and inspire other people
        in my situation. I have already come a long way, and I would like to help other people like me to do the same. <br><br>

        Pascal. <br><br>
