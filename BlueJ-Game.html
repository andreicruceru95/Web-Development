                    While learning Java programming, we were asked to create several basic applications using the BlueJ software. <br>
                    Some of this applications include: A ticket machine software, a database software that keeps track of students and their 
                    courses and modules, a stock management software and a text-based game. <br><br>

                    'Colossal Cave Adventure (also known as ADVENT, Colossal Cave, or Adventure)[1] is a text adventure game, 
                    developed between 1975 and 1977 by Will Crowther for the PDP-10 mainframe. The game was expanded upon in 
                    1977 with help from Don Woods, and other programmers created variations on the game and ports to other systems 
                    in the following years. <br>
                    In the game, the player controls a character through simple text commands to explore a cave rumored to be 
                    filled with wealth. Players earn predetermined points for acquiring treasure and escaping the cave alive, 
                    with the goal to earn the maximum number of points offered. The concept bore out from Crowther's background 
                    as a caving enthusiast, with the game's cave structured loosely around the Mammoth Cave system in Kentucky. <br>
                    Colossal Cave Adventure is the first known work of interactive fiction and, as the first text adventure game, 
                    is considered the precursor for the adventure game genre. Colossal Cave Adventure also contributed towards 
                    the role-playing and roguelike genres.' <br><br>

                    Inside this fortress there is a drunk man. By interacting with it, he will tell the player that he 
                    used to be an adventurer, and gives the player a magic stone that will allow the player to travel between 
                    known locations. <br>       
                    On the west side of the fortress, the player will meet a teleporter. Interacting with this will

                    While traveling through this town the player will come across a guardian, which will 
                    point the player to the next teleporter. <br>
                    Reaching this teleporter means the player needs to explore a part of the forest, where

                    After finding the next teleporter, the player will be able to travel to the forrest.

                    This way, the player must explore the whole map to find clues. <br>
                    This map connects to two other maps: The Dessert and The Mountain. <br>
