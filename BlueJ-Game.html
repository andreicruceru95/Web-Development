                                    He also designed some of the maps, to go along with the story.

                                    He also proved realy helpful in designing some of the functions as, I assume, he plays lots of games.

                    The action takes place in a post-apocalyptic world.
                    The player finds itself in a fortress, a place where humans are hiding 
                    themselves from the outside evil. While exploring the fortress, the player 
                    will find various items and gold(game currency) hidden in bags and barrels. <br>
                    There are a few soldiers and 'humans' in the fortress. They will communicate with
                     the player, and give him tasks.

                <p id="text">
                    As we are not yet familiar with graphics rendering, I decided to make the game a bit more fun 
                    and print the game on the terminal window, and it looks a lot better than I anticipated. <br>

                    The map is a 2D Array (Matrix), and the player has a visual field that only alows him to see 
                    three squares around him. I used html4 and html5 characters to represend various objects on the map,
                    like monsters and people.

                    I am planning to develop this game in the years to come, into a full application software
