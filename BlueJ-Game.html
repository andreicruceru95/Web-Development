        While learning Java programming, we were asked to create several basic applications using the BlueJ software. <br>
        Some of this applications include: A ticket machine software, a database software that keeps track of students and their
        courses and modules, a stock management software and a text-based game. <br><br>

        I'm going to talk about this game and my learning experience while building it.

        'Colossal Cave Adventure (also known as ADVENT, Colossal Cave, or Adventure)[1] is a text adventure game,
        developed between 1975 and 1977 by Will Crowther for the PDP-10 mainframe. The game was expanded upon in
        1977 with help from Don Woods, and other programmers created variations on the game and ports to other systems
        in the following years. <br>
        In the game, the player controls a character through simple text commands to explore a cave rumored to be
        filled with wealth. Players earn predetermined points for acquiring treasure and escaping the cave alive,
        with the goal to earn the maximum number of points offered. The concept bore out from Crowther's background
        as a caving enthusiast, with the game's cave structured loosely around the Mammoth Cave system in Kentucky. <br>
        Colossal Cave Adventure is the first known work of interactive fiction and, as the first text adventure game,
        is considered the precursor for the adventure game genre. Colossal Cave Adventure also contributed towards
        the role-playing and roguelike genres.' <br><br>

        The action takes place in a post-apocalyptic world.
        The player finds itself in a fortress, a place where humans are hiding
        themselves from the outside evil. Here, the player will find out it's purpose -
        to bring back the mythical stone and place it in the church. <br>
        The player must find out the location of it, and how to obtain it.
        <br><br>

        <strong>The fortress</strong> is the start point of the player. <br>
        In this map, the player will meet a shop owner, who will allow the player to
        purchase health potions and chest keys. Next to this shop, there is a blacksmith,
        where the player can improve it's equipment in exchange of gold, the game currency. <br>
        While exploring the fortress, the player will find various items and gold hidden inside buildings.
        The player will also obtain quests or get tips by interacting with people in the game. As rewards for
        completing this quests the player will be given gold and items. <br>
        Inside this fortress there is a drunk man. By interacting with it, he will tell the player that he
        used to be an adventurer, and gives the player a magic stone that will allow the player to travel between
        known locations. <br>
        On the west side of the fortress, the player will meet a teleporter. Interacting with this will
        allow the player to move to the next map, the Town.

        While traveling through this town the player will come across a guardian, which will
        point the player to the next teleporter. <br>
        Reaching this teleporter means the player needs to explore a part of the forest, where
        he will fight animals and obtain quest items and gold. <br>
        After finding the next teleporter, the player will be able to travel to the forrest.

        There is no other game objects here, but this map is designed like a maze, to spice things up.
        This way, the player must explore the whole map to find clues. <br>
        This map connects to two other maps: The Dessert and The Mountain. <br>
        The two teleporters in this map are located in east and south.

        the player will find a jurnal
        that gives tips about the dessert and it's importance. <br>
        At the center of the maps, a teleporter will lead to the Spider Cave, but only if the player has
        obtained the spider key, which is guarded by the Nine Tails, a fox, up on the mountain.

        The player finds himself at the first floor, where some low level monsters are located. <br>
        In order to progress through the tower, the player must clear the room. Once the room is cleared, a teleporer will
        appear, and will take the player to the next floor, that contains stronger monsters.<br>
        The tower has 6 floors in total. On the fifth floor, the player will face the death, the second strongest monster
        in the game. Killing this, will make the player face the Red Dragon which drops the Mythical stone that the player
        needs to save the world. <br>
        After the player kills the dragon, he will be teleported back in the spider cave.
