                <h2>Why Data Science?</h2>
                    I have always been atracted to the IT industry.  
                    I was fascinated with the power of computers ever sice I was 8 years old, when my parents brought me my first computer
                    with the help of an European Educational program. 
                    It was only a basic office desktop tower with limited posibilites, but it was enough for me to decide 
                    that my future career will involve working with them. <br> <br>
                 
                    I started to pursue this career by applying for an IT and mathematics college, and I was accepted. 
                    During college, I obtaind various IT skills, including Microsoft Office and Oracle SQL.
                    Years later, I was unable to apply for higher degrees due to financial reasons. I have spent a lot of time trying to 
                    understand the evolution of the industry and trying to find my place in it. 
                     While developing my SQL skills, I learned about the importance and the potential of data, and decided to follow a career in
                     Data Science. 
                  <br><br>
                    I have finaly decided to join university after 6 years of break from any eductional enviroment, and it was a great decision. 
                    I realised I do have a passion for learning new skills, and I am a lot more capable than I thought I was. <br><br>
                    But what is Data Science?

                    What is Data Science
                </h2>
                    Data science is an inter-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms 
                    and systems to extract knowledge and insights from many structural and unstructured data.
                    Data science is related to data mining, machine learning and big data.
                    Data science is a "concept to unify statistics, data analysis and their related methods"
                    in order to "understand and analyze actual phenomena" with data.
                    It uses techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics,
                    statistics, computer science, domain knowledge and information science. 
                    Turing award winner Jim Gray imagined data science as a "fourth paradigm"
                    of science (empirical, theoretical, computational and now data-driven) and asserted that 
                    "everything about science is changing because of the impact of information technology" and the data deluge. 
                <p style="font-style: italic;">   
                    "Data Science is the study of data. It is about extracting, analyzing, visualizing, managing and storing data 
                    to create insights. These insights help the companies to make powerful data-driven decisions. Data Science requires the 
                    usage of both unstructured and structured data. It is a multidisciplinary field that has its roots in statistics, 
                    math and computer science. It is one of the most highly sought after jobs due to the abundance of data science 
                    position and a lucrative pay-scale."<br> <br> Rinu Gour - <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/why-choose-data-science-for-your-career-ca38db0c28d4#:~:text=Data%20Science%20is%20the%20study,both%20unstructured%20and%20structured%20data." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

                    Foundations
               </h2>
               Data science is an interdisciplinary field focused on extracting knowledge 
               from data sets, which are typically large (see big data).
               The field encompasses analysis, preparing data for analysis, and presenting findings
               to inform high-level decisions in an organization. As such, it incorporates skills
               from computer science, mathematics, statistics, information visualization, graphic design, 
               complex systems, communication and business. Statistician Nathan Yau, drawing on Ben Fry,
               also links data science to human-computer interaction: users should be able to intuitively control
               and explore data. In 2015, the American Statistical Association identified database management,
               statistics and machine learning, and distributed and parallel systems as the three emerging foundational 
               professional communities.

                <h2>
                    Relationship with Statistics
                </h2>
                Many statisticians, including Nate Silver, have argued that data science is not a new field, 
                but rather another name for statistics.[12] Others argue that data science is distinct 
                from statistics because it focuses on problems and techniques unique to digital data.
                Vasant Dhar writes that statistics emphasizes quantitative data and description. 
                In contrast, data science deals with quantitative and qualitative data (e.g. images) and emphasizes prediction and action.
                Andrew Gelman of Columbia University and data scientist Vincent Granville have described statistics as
                a nonessential part of data science. Stanford professor David Donoho writes that data science 
                is not distinguished from statistics by the size of datasets or use of computing, and that many graduate 
                programs misleadingly advertise their analytics and statistics training as the essence of a data science program. 
                He describes data science as an applied field growing out of traditional statistics. 
                In summary, data science can be therefore described as an applied branch of statistics.

                <h2>
                    Early usage
                </h2>
                In 1962, John Tukey described a field he called “data analysis,” which resembles modern data science. 
                In 1985, in a lecture given to the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, C.F. Jeff Wu used the term 
                Data Science for the first time as an alternative name for statistics.[18] Later, attendees at a 1992 statistics 
                symposium at the University of Montpellier II acknowledged the emergence of a new discipline focused on data of various 
                origins and forms, combining established concepts and principles of statistics and data analysis with computing.
                The term “data science” has been traced back to 1974, when Peter Naur proposed it as an alternative name for 
                computer science. In 1996, the International Federation of Classification Societies became the first conference
                to specifically feature data science as a topic. However, the definition was still in flux. After the 1985 lecture in 
                the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, in 1997 C.F. Jeff Wu again suggested that statistics should be renamed 
                data science. He reasoned that a new name would help statistics shed inaccurate stereotypes, such as being synonymous 
                with accounting, or limited to describing data. In 1998, Chikio Hayashi argued for data science as a new, 
                interdisciplinary concept, with three aspects: data design, collection, and analysis.
                During the 1990s, popular terms for the process of finding patterns in datasets (which were increasingly large) 
                included “knowledge discovery” and “data mining”.

                <h2>
                    Modern Usage
                </h2>
               The modern conception of data science as an independent discipline is sometimes attributed to William S. 
                Cleveland. In a 2001 paper, he advocated an expansion of statistics beyond theory into technical areas; 
                because this would significantly change the field, it warranted a new name. "Data science" 
                became more widely used in the next few years: in 2002, the Committee on Data for Science and Technology 
                launched Data Science Journal. In 2003, Columbia University launched The Journal of Data Science.
                In 2014, the American Statistical Association's Section on Statistical Learning and Data Mining changed its
                name to the Section on Statistical Learning and Data Science, reflecting the ascendant popularity of data science.
    
                The professional title of “data scientist” has been attributed to DJ Patil and Jeff Hammerbacher in 2008. 
                Though it was used by the National Science Board in their 2005 report, "Long-Lived Digital Data Collections:
                Enabling Research and Education in the 21st Century," it referred broadly to any key role in managing a digital data collection.
                                
                There is still no consensus on the definition of data science and it is considered by some to be a buzzword.
